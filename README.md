# QR_Code_Generator

This a QR code generating project where from any text entered by the user will be converted into a qr code and the qr code image will be save in qr_image.png and the text or URL text will be saved in user_input.txt.
I have used- inquirer and qr-image from npm module and fs from node.js build-in module.
